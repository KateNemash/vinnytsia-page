      <h1>Welcome to Vinnytsia!</h1>
      <h2>A city that knows how to surprise and inspire new ideas!</h2>

      <p>
        Today Vinnytsia is a modern city located in the center of Ukraine on the
        banks of the Pivdennyi Buh River. Repeatedly recognized as the most
        comfortable city in Ukraine, Vinnytsia has a developed infrastructure
        and is very convenient for living.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, it lives not only for comfort of its inhabitants. Vinnytsia is
        endowed with a special historical and artistic atmosphere. From the
        walls of the 16th century to modern hubs, coworking spaces and shopping
        malls. From street art to galleries and theaters. From bizarre and
        friendly bronze sculptures to large-scale cultural and artistic
        projects. As the capital of Podillia region, Vinnytsia preserves the
        cultural heritage of many generations, as a modern city it takes an
        active part in the artistic life of the country and Europe.
        <br />
        <br />
        Vinnytsia is a city that leaves tourists wanting to return here more
        than once to feel the friendliness, comfort and atmosphere of happiness
        again.
